   1.1. Prompt the user to enter a username and store it in a variable called "username".
   1.2. Prompt the user to enter a password and store it in a variable called "password".
   1.3. Call the function "save_password" with the "username" and "password" variables as arguments.
   1.4. Print a message indicating that the registration was successful.

2. Define a function called "save_password" with arguments "username" and "password":

6. Start an infinite loop:
   6.1. Prompt the user to enter an account number and store it in a variable called "username_input".

       6.2.1. Print a message indicating that the username is correct.
       6.2.2. Break the loop.
   6.3. Otherwise, display an error message indicating that the username is invalid.

7. Start another infinite loop:
   7.1. Prompt the user to enter a password and store it in a variable called "password_input".
   7.2. If the "password_input" variable is equal to the stored "password":
       7.2.1. Print a message indicating that the password is correct.
       7.2.2. Break the loop.
